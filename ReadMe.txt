** Marketing Statistical Model **

This model is to measure the impact of various TV Dayparts like if the Ad runs Early Morning or Weekend, how will it affect the National TV's performance. I did this analysis in a team of 3. We built a linear regression model to get the sales contribuiton of each of the daypart. Before doing regression we applied S-Curves transformations to the actual values to see the saturation levels of dayparts. Based on their contributions we calculated effectiveness, cost efficieny and share of activity of each daypart. Hence by doing this analysis we came to know which are the most efficient dayaparts when it comes to TV.

How to run the code?

Step 1. Please download the daypart_model_input_sample.csv file in your local system.
Step 2. Note the file path where you have saved the file.
Step 3. Mention the path in the beginning of code where setwd is written. It's the first line of code setwd("F:\\Marketing_Model")
Step 4. Please change the "/" to "\\" otherwise the code will throw error.
Step 5. Yes, now you are ready to run the code.
Step 6. After the code is run successfuly there be an output file generated by the name TV_Daypart_contributions.csv in your mentioned location.


Please Note: The data used for analysis is generated randomly so results might be little skewed or numbers might look unbelievably large or small.
